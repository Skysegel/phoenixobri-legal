export const privacyEN = `# PhoeniXobri – Privacy Policy

This privacy policy provides information pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 GDPR about the processing of personal data and health-related data by the controller **Daniel Rößmann (PhoeniXobri)**.

> **Note:** This English version is provided for convenience and orientation only. The legally binding version is the German text (privacyDE).

## 1. Use of Firebase services (required consent)

PhoeniXobri uses services from **Google Firebase** to provide chat and synchronisation features. For each user, a random anonymous identifier (UID) is generated to technically enable communication. No real names, email addresses or location data are stored.

**Services used:** Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Firebase Storage (optional), Firebase Cloud Functions.  
**Legal basis:** Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract).  
**Processor:** Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.  
Processing is based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. For more information, see the [Firebase Privacy and Security documentation](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

## 2. Optional usage analytics with Google Analytics 4

PhoeniXobri optionally uses **Google Analytics 4** via the Firebase platform to analyse app usage in an anonymised form. No personal data is transmitted to Google unless consent has been given.

**Data collected (if consent is given):** App interactions, technical device information, usage duration.  
**Legal basis:** Article 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent).  
Consent can be withdrawn at any time with effect for the future in the app settings.

## 3. Advertising via Google AdMob (optional)

PhoeniXobri may use the **Google AdMob** advertising platform to finance and provide the app. AdMob is a service of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. When ads are displayed, technical information may be transmitted to Google and its advertising partners.

**Data processed (depending on device settings and consent):** Device identifiers (e.g. advertising ID), app usage data (e.g. which screens or features are used), approximate location information, and information about the device used (e.g. operating system, language, screen resolution). This data may be combined by Google with other information from other Google services.

**Legal basis:** To the extent necessary to provide non‑personalised ads, processing is based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in refinancing and operating the app). For the delivery of **personalised advertising** (use of the advertising ID for profiling or tracking purposes), your **consent** pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7 GDPR is required.

**Consent & withdrawal:** You can restrict or disable the use of personalised advertising in your device settings (e.g. "reset advertising ID" or "disable personalised ads"). Where the app provides its own consent prompt for advertising, you can withdraw this consent there at any time with effect for the future.

**Data transfer to third countries:** In connection with AdMob, data may be transferred to servers of Google LLC in the United States or other third countries. Google relies on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses for such transfers. For more information, see the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and the [information on Google AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543).

**Disabling interest-based advertising:** In addition, you can restrict interest-based advertising via the following opt‑out options:

- Android: System settings > Google > Ads (or comparable menu items)
- iOS: Settings > Privacy & Security > Advertising / Tracking (depending on iOS version)

## 4. Processing of health-related data (local storage)

PhoeniXobri offers the option to store personal information about drinking behaviour, age and health parameters locally on the device. This data is not transmitted to the server. However, app data may be included in a cloud backup (e.g. Google Drive, iCloud) by the operating system. Users can disable this in the system settings.

**Legal basis:** Article 9(2)(a) GDPR (explicit consent).

## 5. Processing in the community chat

When using the community chat feature, chat messages, comments and reactions are stored in **Firebase Firestore**. Each message is linked to an anonymous user ID (UID). No real names or email addresses are stored. Users can have their own messages anonymised or deleted at any time. When the account is deleted, all personal links are automatically removed.

Moderation is carried out to ensure a safe and respectful communication environment.  
**Legal basis:** Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract) and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest).

Further information on account and data deletion can be found here: [PhoeniXobri – Account & Data Deletion](delete-account.html).

## 6. Rights of data subjects

Users have the right at any time to obtain access to, rectification, erasure or restriction of processing of their data in accordance with Articles 15–20 GDPR, as well as the right to data portability in accordance with Article 20 GDPR. In addition, users have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77 GDPR.
