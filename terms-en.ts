These terms of use govern the use of the **"PhoeniXobri"** app by users. By installing and using the app, you accept these terms.

> **Note:** This English version is provided for convenience and orientation only. The legally binding version is the German text (TERMS_DE).

## 1. Scope and target group

These terms apply to all functions of the PhoeniXobri app provided by **Daniel Rößmann**. Deviating terms and conditions of the user do not apply unless they have been expressly agreed in writing.  
**Target group:** The app is intended exclusively for private end users and not for companies or medical professionals.

## 2. Description of services

PhoeniXobri is a mobile application for documenting, self-monitoring and supporting the reduction of, or abstinence from, alcohol consumption. Use is strictly limited to private, non-commercial purposes.  
The app does not provide continuous medical monitoring and does not permanently store personal health data on the server side.

## 3. Registration & use

The app can be used anonymously. When the community feature is activated, an anonymous sign‑in is performed via **Firebase Authentication**. No real names, postal addresses or e‑mail addresses are stored.  
Use of the chat features requires consent to the processing of technical data by **Google Firebase**.  
**Data backup:** The user is responsible for regularly backing up locally stored data, in particular before changing devices, resetting the device or uninstalling the app.

## 4. Data protection

The collection and processing of personal or health‑related data is carried out in accordance with the **Privacy Policy** (see the "Datenschutz" section). Without consent to the data processing described there, the app can only be used to a limited extent.

## 5. Disclaimer of liability

PhoeniXobri is intended solely for personal reflection and motivation towards abstinence. The app does **not** replace medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.  
The provider is not liable for damages resulting from the use of the app, from misinterpretation of information, or from technical malfunctions. Liability for data loss or system failures is excluded to the extent permitted by law.  
**No scientific guarantee:** PhoeniXobri does not claim completeness, up‑to‑dateness or scientific accuracy of the information and calculations provided.

## 6. No medical product

The content and calculations of the app are for general information and motivation for self‑reflection only. PhoeniXobri is **not** a medical device and does not replace medical examinations, diagnoses or therapies.

## 7. Community chat & moderation

The app offers an optional community chat feature that allows users to exchange views. It is strictly intended for respectful, topic‑related discussion. No medical consultation takes place there.

### 7.1 Behaviour in the chat

The following content is in particular not permitted in the community chat:

- Insulting, discriminatory or defamatory content
- Advertising, spam or commercial offers
- Political or religious appeals
- Publication of personal data of other users
- Content that violates applicable law or these terms of use

### 7.2 Moderation and measures

The operator reserves the right to remove posts or comments if they violate the rules or are reported.  
In the event of serious or repeated violations, access to the community may be restricted or blocked.

### 7.3 Reporting abuse

Users can flag inappropriate content using the *"report post"* function. Reported content will be reviewed and, if necessary, removed or anonymised.

### 7.4 Deletion and anonymisation

When a user account is deleted, personal data in chat posts will be anonymised. The content itself is retained so that the conversation flow remains comprehensible.  
**Backups:** Complete removal from backup copies may be delayed for technical reasons.
